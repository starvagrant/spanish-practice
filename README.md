## A CLI program for practicing spanish

The following repository contains a command program for improving my spanish.

## Installation Instructions

The program requires a working python 3 interpreter. My personal machine is running python 3.6
and currently uses the cmd and unittest modules. Currently, the program requirss a word list that
I'm not keeping in source control. The countedwords.csv file gives a few practice words. Delete
the commented lines and place it in a directory called **words/**
